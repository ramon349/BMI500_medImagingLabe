# BMI500_medImagingLabe


# How to train 
  We have 2 final training scripts. 
  1) Train.py  trains our baseline model  
  2) leaky_train.py trains our leaky relu model 
  
  Each script only depends on the corresponding build_model  file which is used to build its corresponding models.
  The code is written to run on the BMI cluster were a shared repo contains the actual dataset. The code is a modified version of the code created in
  https://www.kaggle.com/amyjang/tensorflow-pneumonia-classification-on-x-rays . Our goal for this assignemt was to familiarize ourselvves with training 
  models on the cluster
